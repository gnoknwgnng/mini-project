The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested protobuf==4.25.8
    google-ai-generativelanguage 0.6.15 depends on protobuf!=4.21.0, !=4.21.1, !=4.21.2, !=4.21.3, !=4.21.4, !=4.21.5, <6.0.0dev and >=3.20.2

    proto-plus 1.26.1 depends on protobuf<7.0.0 and >=3.19.0
    google-generativeai 0.8.5 depends on protobuf
    grpcio-status 1.71.0 depends on protobuf<6.0dev and >=5.26.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested protobuf==4.25.8
    google-ai-generativelanguage 0.6.15 depends on protobuf!=4.21.0, !=4.21.1, !=4.21.2, !=4.21.3, !=4.21.4, !=4.21.5, <6.0.0dev and >=3.20.2

    googleapis-common-protos 1.70.0 depends on protobuf!=4.21.1, !=4.21.2, !=4.21.3, !=4.21.4, !=4.21.5, <7.0.0 and >=3.20.2
    proto-plus 1.26.1 depends on protobuf<7.0.0 and >=3.19.0
    google-generativeai 0.8.5 depends on protobuf
    grpcio-status 1.71.0 depends on protobuf<6.0dev and >=5.26.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested protobuf==4.25.8
    google-ai-generativelanguage 0.6.15 depends on protobuf!=4.21.0, !=4.21.1, !=4.21.2, !=4.21.3, !=4.21.4, !=4.21.5, <6.0.0dev and >=3.20.2

    googleapis-common-protos 1.70.0 depends on protobuf!=4.21.1, !=4.21.2, !=4.21.3, !=4.21.4, !=4.21.5, <7.0.0 and >=3.20.2
    proto-plus 1.26.1 depends on protobuf<7.0.0 and >=3.19.0
    google-generativeai 0.8.5 depends on protobuf
    grpcio-status 1.71.0 depends on protobuf<6.0dev and >=5.26.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

A distant owl hooted, echoing through the dense forest, while leaves rustled like whispered secrets. Somewhere beyond the trees, a brook murmured softly, weaving its melody through the hush of the night.

Beneath the stars, a figure moved silently, clutching a worn leather satchel filled with maps, old photographs, and a single brass key. No one knew where the key led—but legends spoke of a hidden door, one that only opened under a full moon, when time itself held its breath.

Un búho lejano se gritó, resonando a través del denso bosque, mientras que las hojas susurradas como secretos susurrados. En algún lugar más allá de los árboles, un arroyo murmuró suavemente, tejiendo su melodía a través del silencio de la noche.

Debajo de las estrellas, una figura se movió en silencio, agarrando una cartera de cuero desgastada llena de mapas, fotografías viejas y una sola llave de latón. Nadie sabía a dónde conducía la llave, pero las leyendas hablaban de una puerta oculta, una que solo se abrió bajo una luna llena, cuando el tiempo en sí contó con la respiración.

The appointment booking and consultation segment alone is projected to reach $178.62 billion by 2030 at a 46.4% CAGR.  Driven by patient demand (75% find mobile tech convenient), digital transformation (75% increased digital budgets), and post-COVID acceleration (10-20% virtual appointments), the market is attracting substantial investment – $5.7 billion raised in H1 2024.  Key metrics demonstrate strong ROI, including increased patient satisfaction (89-94%), reduced no-show rates (60%), and administrative cost reductions (12%). The broader healthcare mobile app market is valued at $114.18 billion in 2024 and projected to reach $1.07 trillion by 2030.

[2025-07-18 19:06:06] Action: **Summary:**
Nodes in a blockchain network are categorized into two main types: full nodes and light nodes. Full nodes are further divided into archival full nodes (which maintain a complete blockchain history and enforce consensus), mining nodes (which create new blocks on proof-of-work blockchains), staking nodes (which validate blocks on proof-of-stake blockchains), and authority nodes (typically hand-picked validators). Pruned full nodes store only the most recent blocks to reduce storage requirements. Light nodes are less resource-intensive and primarily used for transaction checks. The Bitcoin Lightning Network utilizes a specific type of node for off-chain transactions.

[2025-07-18 19:06:51] Action: **Summary:**
Nodes in a blockchain network can be categorized into two main types: full nodes and light nodes. Full nodes are further divided into archival full nodes (which maintain a complete blockchain history and enforce consensus), mining nodes (involved in proof-of-work blockchains and earning rewards), staking nodes (involved in proof-of-stake blockchains), and authority nodes (hand-picked validators). Pruned full nodes store only recent blocks to reduce storage requirements. Light nodes are less resource-intensive and primarily used for transactions, relying on full nodes for consensus. The Bitcoin Lightning Network utilizes a specific type of node for off-chain transactions.

[2025-07-18 19:07:10] Action: Here's a concise summary of the text about blockchain nodes:

**Blockchain nodes come in several types, each with a specific function:**

*   **Archival Full Nodes:** Maintain a complete copy of the blockchain’s history, essential for network integrity and reconstruction in case of failure. They are further divided into:
    *   **Mining Nodes:** Create new blocks on Proof-of-Work blockchains and receive rewards.
    *   **Staking Nodes (Validators):** Validate new blocks on Proof-of-Stake blockchains, locking up their crypto as a deterrent.
    *   **Authority Nodes:** Hand-picked validators used in partially decentralized networks.
    *   **Masternodes:** Validate transactions and keep records, but cannot add new blocks.

*   **Pruned Full Nodes:**  Store only the most recent blocks to reduce storage requirements, while still performing full node functions.

*   **Light Nodes:** Require minimal hardware and bandwidth, ideal for everyday operations like checking balances and broadcasting transactions, but don't enforce consensus rules. They rely on full nodes for other information.

*   **Lightning Nodes:** Used in the Lightning Network for off-chain transactions.

**Key takeaway:** Different node types contribute to the overall operation, security, and functionality of a blockchain network.
